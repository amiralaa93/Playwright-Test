# Playwright Test Automation with GitHub Actions

## üìå Overview
This project uses **Playwright** for end-to-end (E2E) testing, with **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD, **parallel execution**, and **email notifications** for test failures.

---

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Playwright**
Run the following command to initialize Playwright:

```sh
npm init playwright@latest
```

This will:
- Install **Playwright Test**
- Set up a **playwright.config.ts** file
- Add sample tests


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Running Tests Locally**
To execute all tests:
```sh
npx playwright test
```

To run tests in **headed mode** (visible browser):
```sh
npx playwright test --headed
```

To run tests in **parallel** (default behavior):
```sh
npx playwright test --workers=4
```

---

## üîß Configuration (playwright.config.ts)
Modify `playwright.config.ts` to enable reporting and parallel execution:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    browserName: 'chromium',  // Options: chromium, firefox, webkit
    headless: true,
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure'
  },
  reporter: [['html', { open: 'never' }]],  // Enables HTML reports
  workers: 4,  // Runs 4 tests in parallel
});
```

---

## üì© Email Notifications for Test Failures
This setup sends **email notifications** if tests fail using **SMTP (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Configure SMTP Credentials in GitHub Secrets**
Go to **GitHub Repository** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**, and add:
- `SMTP_SERVER` ‚Üí e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`
- `SMTP_PORT` ‚Üí `587`
- `EMAIL_USERNAME` ‚Üí Your email (e.g., `your-email@gmail.com`)
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` ‚Üí **App Password** (not your regular password)

> **For Gmail**: Generate an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)


### **2Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`)

```yaml

          username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
          subject: "üö® Playwright Test Failed"
          body: "Some Playwright tests failed. Check the attached report."
          to: "recipient1@example.com, recipient2@example.com"
          from: "your-email@gmail.com"
          attachments: "playwright-report.zip"
```

## üìä Viewing Test Reports
After tests run, an **HTML report** is generated. To view it:
```sh
npx playwright show-report
```
In GitHub Actions, download the **playwright-report.zip** artifact from the workflow run.
